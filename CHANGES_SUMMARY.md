# Shopping Lists - Changes Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed mock data for shopping lists and integrated the real API functionality for creating and managing lists.

## Changes Made

### 1. **stores/lists.ts** - Removed Mock Data
- ✅ Removed all mock shopping lists data (3 hardcoded lists)
- ✅ Replaced with empty array: `const lists = ref<ShoppingList[]>([])`
- ✅ Removed `addList()` function from exports
- ✅ Added comment noting that list CRUD operations are now handled by API via `useShoppingList` composable

### 2. **views/ListasView.vue** - Integrated Real API
- ✅ Added `useShoppingList` composable import
- ✅ Replaced mock store data with real API data (`shoppingLists` from composable)
- ✅ Updated `sortedLists` computed to work with API data structure
- ✅ Updated `deleteList()` to call API endpoint via `deleteShoppingList()`
- ✅ Removed favorite star feature (not supported by API)
- ✅ Updated template to display `list.description` as subtitle
- ✅ Changed ID types from `string` to `number` to match API

### 3. **components/CreateListModal.vue** - Real List Creation
- ✅ Added `useShoppingList` composable integration
- ✅ Created local state for form fields:
  - `listName` - required field
  - `listDescription` - optional field
  - `isRecurring` - boolean checkbox
- ✅ Updated `createList()` function to:
  - Call `useShoppingListStore().add()` API method
  - Refresh list data with `getAllShoppingLists()`
  - Show loading state during creation
  - Handle errors with user feedback
- ✅ Simplified modal UI:
  - Removed product management (products added separately after list creation)
  - Clean form with name, description, and recurring checkbox
  - Added informative note that products can be added later
  - Better UX with cancel/create buttons

## API Integration Details

### Creating a List
The modal now calls the real API endpoint:
```typescript
POST /api/shopping-lists
{
  "name": "List Name",
  "description": "List Description", 
  "recurring": false,
  "metadata": {}
}
```

### Fetching Lists
Lists are automatically loaded from the API on mount via:
```typescript
GET /api/shopping-lists?page=1&per_page=10&sort_by=name&order=ASC
```

### Deleting Lists
Delete operations now call:
```typescript
DELETE /api/shopping-lists/{id}
```

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Simplified Creation Flow**: Users can now quickly create a list with just a name and description
2. **Real-time Updates**: Lists refresh automatically after creation or deletion
3. **Loading States**: Clear feedback when creating or deleting lists
4. **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages if operations fail
5. **Better Validation**: Form validation prevents empty list names

## Notes

- Mock data still exists for products, pantry sections, and history (not modified)
- The old `lists` array in the store is kept for backward compatibility with other features
- Favorite functionality removed as it's not supported by the current API
- Products are now added to lists separately after list creation (following API design)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a new list with name only
- [ ] Create a new list with name and description
- [ ] Create a recurring list
- [ ] Verify list appears in the list view
- [ ] Delete a list
- [ ] Verify list is removed from view
- [ ] Test error handling (network issues, invalid data)
- [ ] Verify lists persist after page refresh
